    "Where does Linear Regression fit in?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised vs Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning problems fall into one of two categories: supervised or unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **supervised learning**, we wish to fit a model that relates the response to the predictors, with one of the following aims in mind:\n",
    "* accurately predicting the response for future observations - **prediction**\n",
    "* better understanding the relationship between the response and the predictors - **inference**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **unsupervised learning** is applied in unlabeled datasets. We are not interested in prediction, because we do not have an associated response variable. Instead we wish to answer questions such as:\n",
    "* Is there an informative way to visualize the data?\n",
    "* Can we discover subgroups among the variables or among the observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further distinguish machine learning algorithms by the output they produce:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression vs Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of output, two main types of machine learning models exist: those for regression and those for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tend to refer to problems with a quantitative response as regression problems, while those involving a qualitative response are often referred to as classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of some examples of regression and classification problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is the most popular machine leaning model for regression. It is often underrated because of its relative simplicity, however, more complex models may fit the data better, at the cost of losing simplicity or interpretability.\n"

An $R^2$ statistic that is close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response is explained by the regression.
